## Overview

A fully functional and beautiful frontend quiz with a light/dark mode toggle, done with React !

## Challenges Faced

- **React**  

  This challenge was another milestone for me! It's been awhile writing with React so I wasn't used to building with the React ecosystem, being so used to writing in HTML, CSS and vanilla JS. I felt like this challenge was a react 'baptism' for me, but it was worth it as I managed to pull through !

- **State Management**
    Handling state with useReducer was initially challenging, but it allowed me to manage complex state logic effectively. I learned how to structure state updates and actions to keep the app scalable and maintainable.

- **Dynamic Data Fetching**
Loading quiz data from a JSON file and dynamically rendering it required careful planning. I had to ensure the app handled loading states and errors.

- **Responsive Design**
Creating a responsive layout that works seamlessly across devices was a key focus. I used CSS Grid, Flexbox, and media queries to achieve a fluid and adaptive design.

## Key Features
- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle:** Users can switch between light and dark themes for a personalized experience.

- **Dynamic Quiz Rendering:** Quizzes are loaded dynamically from a JSON file, allowing for easy updates and scalability.

- **Progress Tracking:** A progress bar shows users how far they’ve progressed through the quiz.

- **Instant Feedback:** Correct answers are highlighted in green, and incorrect answers are highlighted in red after submission.

- **Score Calculation:** The app tracks the user’s score and displays it at the end of the quiz.

- **Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive and works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.**

## Tools & Techniques:

- **HTML5 & CSS3:** Used for structuring and styling the app. CSS variables were leveraged for theming (light/dark mode).

- **JavaScript:**

- **React:** Built the app using React, utilizing components, props, and hooks (useState, useReducer, useEffect).

 - **State Management:** Managed complex state logic with useReducer for quizzes, answers, and progress tracking.

 - **Dynamic Rendering:** Dynamically rendered quiz questions and options based on the current state.

 - **Responsive Design:** Used CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout. Implemented media queries to ensure the app looks great on all screen sizes.

- **Problem-Solving:** Debugged and resolved issues like state management errors and dynamic data fetching challenges.

## Lessons Learned:

- **React Fundamentals:** Gained a solid understanding of React components, state, props, and hooks.

- **State Management:** Learned how to use useReducer for managing complex state logic in a scalable way.

- **Debugging:** Developed problem-solving skills by identifying and fixing errors in state management and data fetching.
